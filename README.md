# Heart Platformer

Followed a guide by HeartBeast on Youtube on how to create a platformer in Godot. Playlist if found [Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn0i9GYBoTY-SI3yOBZjH1kJ&si=Vm6DNC4l7LhxHxM7)

This is my first experience working with gamedev. I've learned a lot from this series and hopefully I can continue working with Godot to produce my own projects in the future.
